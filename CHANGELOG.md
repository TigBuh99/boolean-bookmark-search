# Changelog

## [v1.1.1-beta] - 2025-10-17
### Added
- Autocomplete dropdown for `tag:` queries (keyboard + mouse support).
- Tag panel listing all tags with counts, click-to-search.
- Clicking or selecting tags appends with `AND` instead of overwriting.
- Tags displayed without the `tag:` prefix for consistency.

### Notes
- Marked as **Beta** pending full testing.
- Search remains case-insensitive and accent-insensitive, but results echo the query terms as entered.
